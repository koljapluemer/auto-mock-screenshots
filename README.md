idea: simply paste screenshots of a project in the relevant folder, run script, and have nice mocks for SLT, portfolio, gAds, ProductHunt, whatever


## Using it

- go into `venv`, make sure `pillow` is installed
- make a subfolder in screenshots/ with your project
- in it, slap any screenshots you want
- find a nice `bg.png` on Unsplash or something, add it 
- make a `resolutions.txt` â€” can be empty, or include lines like `2000x1000`.
- run `mock_screenshots.py`
